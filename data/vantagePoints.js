    description: `
Walking down Conigre hill with the stone walls on each side you
are suddenly welcomed by this magnificent view as the walls begin to lower.

Conigre hill is situated on the west side of town, looking across the town
to the hills beyond you can see the edge of Salisbury plain and the Westbury
White Horse.

From the left you can see the triangular roof of the library next to the
river. The library is home to the Bradford on Avon Museum which holds a
broad collection from our Roman, iron and rubber past to Moulton bicycles,
brewing and pubs.

In the middle of your view you can see the rooftop of Abbey Mill which has
also seen time as a Cloth Mill and Rubber factory.

To the right are views across Barton Farm and Frome Road.

The often undiscovered gem, the view out over the Tithe Barn
from the gardens of St Mary Tory.

The name Tory comes from the old word 'tor' which means 'hill', and from this lofty vantage point you have a fabulous panorama across
the whole town and beyond. From direct line of sight of the Tithe Barn
to the River and playing fields.

This whole area of Tory and Middle rank were gradually built over hundreds
of years from the 1690s to the 19th century.

Take a moment out to watch the activity along the Barton farm walk,
the Avon river and the canal. This is the less busy side of the river
with a real sense of space as you drink in setting.

Cross the packhorse bridge from near the farmhouse towards the rowing club
building and the train track. As you reach the other side you will see a
path going off to the left.

The whole Budbury area is on an old Iron Age Fort site. The Budbury Monor
House was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086.

You can access a footpath coming down in to town at the end of Budbury Place.
Alternatively you can come up from town via Conigre Hill and around the back
of the houses on Tory.

Following the path to the right you are teased with glimpses into the valley
as you follow the winding paths down the hill.

One of the most stunning panoramas from the southern end of the town can be
seen from outside the Scout Hut at the top of St Margaret's Steps.

St Margaret's Steps can be found hidden between the houses on Bridge Street
just opposite the Library. Follow them to the top and turn left. You will
soon come to the Scout Hut. A footpath to the side of the hut is a nice way
to come back down through the trees to the Secret Wier.
